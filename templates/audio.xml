<title>Living the Cross-Centered Life - Mark 9:30-50</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  As Jesus makes his way towards
Jerusalem and the death that's waiting there for him, he narrows his
focus to teaching his disciples what it means to follow a Messiah who
suffers.  The cross sets the pattern for Christian discipleship, and
this text offers concrete examples.  A life modeled on the cross is a
life that puts the interests of others above its own, and it's a life
that fights a radical battle with sin.</description>

<title>Belief, Unbelief, and the Saving Power of Jesus - Mark 9:14-29</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  In this story of demon possession and exorcism, Mark returns to one of his favorite questions: what must we do to claim the saving power of Jesus?  It's a story that illustrates what we know from our own experience: unbelief comes from many sources and in many forms.  But in the desperate plea of a helpless father Mark illustrates another, even more powerful truth.  It's a decision to rest on Jesus--not mathematical certainty--which constitutes the faith that leads to deliverance.</description>

<title>Glory, Shame, and the Christian Paradox - Mark 9:1-13</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  Just after Jesus has told his disciples that he must suffer and die, and that following him means they will suffer too, Jesus reinforces their confidence in him with a glimpse of his glory, a mysterious event called the transfiguration.  In this story and in Jesus's discussion with his disciples about this event, Mark helps us understand a central Christian paradox: as Son of God Jesus is undeniably glorious, but his glory as Messiah comes through a death of unimaginable shame.</description>

<title>Jesus Is the Christ - A Review of Mark 1-8</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  The stories of Jesus's life
and teaching in Mark's Gospel are designed to answer three main
questions: who is Jesus, what did Jesus come here to do, and what does
that require of us?  Already, in chapters 1-8, we've seen the shape of
Mark's answer to those crucial questions emerge.  First, Jesus is the
divine Son of God, as shown in his unmatched words and actions of
authority and power.  Second, he came to fix what was broken, to
establish the kingdom of God by his life, death, and resurrection.
And, finally, Jesus demands absolute submission from us: a repentance
from all competing allegiances, a rest in the sufficiency of his power
and love, and a willigness to follow him with a life of
self-denial.</description>

<title>Christmas and the Story of Salvation - Isaiah 9:1-7</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  To fully appreciate why
Jesus's birth matters so much, we have to understand where it falls in
the overarching story the Bible tells about God's work of salvation.
Isaiah 9 offers one of the most important clues, hundreds of years
before Jesus was actually born. The prophet claims that the people who
walked in darkness have seen a light because a child was born.  In
other words, we've got to understand the meaning of this darkness and
we've got to understand the meaning of this light if we're to
understand the meaning of the child.</description>

<title>The Christ, the Cross, and Christian Discipleship - Mark 8:31-38</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  This exchange between Jesus
and his disciples represents a turning point in Mark's Gospel.  Just
after Peter's climactic confession of Jesus as the Christ, Jesus
explains what kind of Christ he would be and what that implied for all
who would follow him.  Jesus explains to his followers--and to
us--that there is no Christ without the cross and resurrection, and
there is no Christian discipleship without suffering.

<title>Seeing and Believing - Mark 8:1-30</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>
Speaker: Matt McCullough.  In this cluster of stories Mark helps
explain why people respond to Jesus in very different ways, some in
faith and others with persistent unbelief. Contrasting the disciples'
struggle to believe even after all they'd seen with Peter's dramatic
confession of Jesus as the Christ, Mark shows us that spiritual sight
is never the same thing as physical sight. Faith--seeing with new
eyes--is a gift of God.

<title>Jesus's Radical Message of Sin and Salvation - Mark 7</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. In chapter 7, by relating
Jesus's confrontation with the Pharisees along with his ministry among
the Gentiles, Mark exposes the two sides of Jesus's radical message:
the problem of sin is universal, but the promise of salvation is
universal too.

<title>Rooted in God's Word - Psalm 119</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: John Kramp. In this psalm, a memoir of life
lived through God's word, we are challenged to cultivate both depth
and breadth in our understanding of scripture and to apply God's Word
to the raw circumstances of real life.

<title>Overexposure and Underappreciation - Mark 6:1-56</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. In chapter 6 Mark illustrates
how we should respond to Jesus by contrast to two more examples of
unbelief.  People in Jesus's hometown were offended by his claims to
authority because they'd been inoculated through overexposure.  They
were familiar with Jesus as brother and son and carpenter, but he
seemed too familiar for them to accept his radical words or actions.
Jesus's disciples struggle with another sort of unbelief, which Mark
illustrates with the stories of Jesus feeding 5000 people and Jesus
walking on water.  Confronted with vivid danger, the disciples respond
in fear because, as Mark explains, they failed to appreciate the
significance of Jesus's miraculous provision in the past.

<title>Jesus Is More Powerful - Mark 4:35-5:43</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. Mark demonstrates in these
stories that Jesus is more powerful than nature, evil, sickness, and
even death.  In each case, the person or group afflicted with their
malady is paralized by fear.  Jesus's response to them is his message
to us, "Do not fear, only believe."

<title>The Kingdom Is Like... - Mark 4:21-34</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  In this batch of parables
Jesus explains what the kingdom is like by analogy to familiar images,
all of which aim to show why the kingdom doesn't look like most
expected. The kingdom is like a lamp which, though hidden initially,
is ultimately brought in to be revealed. It's like a seed that grows
even though the farmer merely goes to sleep and wakes up again; in
other words, kingdom growth is inevitable because God alone makes it
grow. And the kingdom is like a mustard seed, small in its beginning
but unmatched in its end. If this is what the kingdom is like, how do
we respond?

<title>What Do We Do With Jesus? - Mark 3:7-35</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  There is more than one way to
respond to the claims and work of Jesus.  Mark gives us three options.
We can respond by calling him a crazy eccentric, an evil demon, or
Lord.

<title>Jesus and Religion-as-Usual - Mark 2:18-3:6</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. Mark begins to document the
opposition that builds against Jesus, ultimately leading to his
execution.  Why did the religious leaders, who were experts of the
law, fail to understand the signficance of Jesus and his kingdom?  How
do we avoid similar error? (We apologize that this recording is
missing the first two minutes. -Ed)

<title>Will You Be Forgiven? - Mark 2:1-17</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. At the beginning of chapter 2,
Mark reveals new dimensions of Jesus's identity and mission.  Mark's
stories show that Jesus has the unique ability to forgive sins, and
that this is precisely what he came here to do.  The only question,
then, is whether you will come to Jesus for forgiveness.</description>

<title>Jesus's Liberating Authority - Mark 1:16-45</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. In this passage Mark tells a group of stories designed to show that Jesus came preaching the kingdom with a remarkably distinctive authority.  But these stories also reveal a paradoxical truth: submission to Jesus's loving authority sets you free.</description>
