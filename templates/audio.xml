<title>Overexposure and Underappreciation - Mark 6:1-56</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. In chapter 6 Mark illustrates
how we should respond to Jesus by contrast to two more examples of
unbelief.  People in Jesus's hometown were offended by his claims to
authority because they'd been inoculated through overexposure.  They
were familiar with Jesus as brother and son and carpenter, but he
seemed too familiar for them to accept his radical words or actions.
Jesus's disciples struggle with another sort of unbelief, which Mark
illustrates with the stories of Jesus feeding 5000 people and Jesus
walking on water.  Confronted with vivid danger, the disciples respond
in fear because, as Mark explains, they failed to appreciate the
significance of Jesus's miraculous provision in the past.

<title>Jesus Is More Powerful - Mark 4:35-5:43</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. Mark demonstrates in these
stories that Jesus is more powerful than nature, evil, sickness, and
even death.  In each case, the person or group afflicted with their
malady is paralized by fear.  Jesus's response to them is his message
to us, "Do not fear, only believe."

<title>The Kingdom Is Like... - Mark 4:21-34</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  In this batch of parables
Jesus explains what the kingdom is like by analogy to familiar images,
all of which aim to show why the kingdom doesn't look like most
expected. The kingdom is like a lamp which, though hidden initially,
is ultimately brought in to be revealed. It's like a seed that grows
even though the farmer merely goes to sleep and wakes up again; in
other words, kingdom growth is inevitable because God alone makes it
grow. And the kingdom is like a mustard seed, small in its beginning
but unmatched in its end. If this is what the kingdom is like, how do
we respond?

<title>What Do We Do With Jesus? - Mark 3:7-35</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  There is more than one way to
respond to the claims and work of Jesus.  Mark gives us three options.
We can respond by calling him a crazy eccentric, an evil demon, or
Lord.

<title>Jesus and Religion-as-Usual - Mark 2:18-3:6</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. Mark begins to document the
opposition that builds against Jesus, ultimately leading to his
execution.  Why did the religious leaders, who were experts of the
law, fail to understand the signficance of Jesus and his kingdom?  How
do we avoid similar error? (We apologize that this recording is
missing the first two minutes. -Ed)

<title>Will You Be Forgiven? - Mark 2:1-17</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. At the beginning of chapter 2,
Mark reveals new dimensions of Jesus's identity and mission.  Mark's
stories show that Jesus has the unique ability to forgive sins, and
that this is precisely what he came here to do.  The only question,
then, is whether you will come to Jesus for forgiveness.</description>

<title>Jesus's Liberating Authority - Mark 1:16-45</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough. In this passage Mark tells a group of stories designed to show that Jesus came preaching the kingdom with a remarkably distinctive authority.  But these stories also reveal a paradoxical truth: submission to Jesus's loving authority sets you free.</description>

<title>Who Is Jesus? - Mark 1:1-16</title>
<link>http://tcnash.org/audio.html</link>
<description>Speaker: Matt McCullough.  In order to consider the gospel of Jesus Christ about which Mark writes, we must ask answer three questions: Who is Jesus?  What did he come here to do?  What does he require of us?</description>
