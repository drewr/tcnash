<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-05-16-Acts-1-8.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
Using Jesus' commission to his followers in Acts 1, we unpack how the
church exists to witness to Jesus through both its clear verbal
testimony and through the quality of its life as community.

<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-05-23-Acts-2-13-17.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
The church exists to witness to Jesus, which means clearly explaining
what he is like and why his life and work matter.  We look at several
of the apostles' speeches to show the content of their message about
Jesus.

<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-06-06-Acts-2-42-47.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
Witnessing to Jesus also involves the church living as a distinct
community that illustrates his character.  Luke summarizes how members
of the first church shared all of life together.

<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-06-20-Gospel-TC-Overview.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
This series introduction answers two simple questions: What is the
gospel?  And why does the gospel matter for church life?

The Gospel and Trinity Church: The Gospel and Community<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-06-27-Gospel-TC-Community.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
Strong community, we believe, is essential for healthy, God-honoring
church life.  The gospel both creates and controls healthy community.

The Gospel and Trinity Church: Worship<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-07-18-Gospel-TC-Worship.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
What does the gospel have to do with our worship?  The gospel makes
all worship possible, and it sets the content for our corporate
worship services as we respond together to what God has said and done.
We also discuss this and how worship will look at Trinity.

The Gospel and Trinity Church: Prayer<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-07-25-Gospel-TC-Prayer.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
Our goal as individual believers and as a corporate body is to engage
the power that brought Jesus from the grave. Because that power is
God's and not ours, the only tool available to us is prayer.  The
gospel tells us why we pray and what to pray.

The church's mission is both to <em>explain</em> the gospel
and <em>illustrate</em> the gospel.
