Jesus's Liberating Authority - Mark 1:16-45<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-09-26-Mark-1-Jesus-Liberating-Authority.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
In this passage Mark tells a group of stories designed to show that
Jesus came preaching the kingdom with a remarkably distinctive
authority.  But these stories also reveal a paradoxical truth:
submission to Jesus's loving authority sets you free.

Who Is Jesus? - Mark 1:1-16<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-09-19-Mark-1-Who-Is-Jesus.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
If we are to understand why Mark labels his story about Jesus as "good
news," we must first see how he answers the three questions at the
heart of his story: Who is Jesus?  What did Jesus come here to do?
And what does that require of us?

Between February and September of 2010, a group of approximately
thirty people met weekly at a local community center to discuss why
Nashville may need another church.  Each of these sessions was
recorded and is available <a href="audio/sevier.html">here</a>.
