What Do We Do With Jesus? - Mark 3:7-35<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-17-Mark-3-What-Do-We-Do-With-Jesus.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
There is more than one way to respond to the claims and work of Jesus.
Mark gives us three options.  We can respond by calling him a crazy
eccentric, an evil demon, or Lord.

Jesus and Religion-as-Usual - Mark 2:18-3:6<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-10-Mark-2-3-Jesus-And-Religion.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
Mark begins to document the opposition that builds against Jesus,
ultimately leading to his execution.  Why did the religious leaders,
who were experts of the law, fail to understand the signficance of
Jesus and his kingdom?  How do we avoid similar error?  <i>(We

Will You Be Forgiven? - Mark 2:1-17<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-03-Mark-2-Will-You-Be-Forgiven.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
At the beginning of chapter 2, Mark reveals new dimensions of Jesus's
identity and mission.  Mark's stories show that Jesus has the unique
ability to forgive sins, and that this is precisely what he came here
to do.  The only question, then, is whether you will come to Jesus for
forgiveness.

Jesus's Liberating Authority - Mark 1:16-45<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-09-26-Mark-1-Jesus-Liberating-Authority.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
In this passage Mark tells a group of stories designed to show that
Jesus came preaching the kingdom with a remarkably distinctive
authority.  But these stories also reveal a paradoxical truth:
submission to Jesus's loving authority sets you free.

Who Is Jesus? - Mark 1:1-16<br/>
<i>Matt McCullough</i> &#8212;
<a href="http://media.tcnash.org/2010-09-19-Mark-1-Who-Is-Jesus.mp3">MP3</a><br/>
If we are to understand why Mark labels his story about Jesus as "good
news," we must first see how he answers the three questions at the
heart of his story: Who is Jesus?  What did Jesus come here to do?
And what does that require of us?

<h3>Sevier Park Sessions</h3>

<p>
Between February and September of 2010, a group of approximately
thirty people met weekly at a local community center to discuss why
Nashville may need another church.  Each of these sessions was
recorded and is available <a href="audio/sevier.html">here</a>.
