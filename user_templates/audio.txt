Paradise Lost - Genesis 3    
*Matt McCullough*    
Genesis, as a story of beginnings, explains the roots of a reality we can't reasonbly deny: this world is not what it ought to be.  Genesis 3 explains something of the nature of sin, that it replaces God's authority with ours; the results of sin, that it destroys relationships, separates us from God, and ultimately brings death; and the solution for sin, that one we now know to be Jesus would come to perfectly solve the problem of sin.

Made in God's Image - Genesis 1:26-31    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-04-10-Gen-1-Made-in-Gods-Image.mp3)    
The conclusion to Genesis 1 claims that humans are unique among God's
creatures because they're made in the image of God.  That was a
counter-cultural claim when first written and, in some ways, remains
so today.  But unique how?  This text suggests the image of God gives
us unique dignity, unique responsibility, and unique accountability.

**Sunday, 3 April 2011**    
In the Beginning - Genesis 1:1-27   
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-04-03-Gen-1-In-The-Beginning.mp3)    
The story of Genesis--a book of beginnings--opens with a poem that
answers questions as old as time: Where did we come from?  Why is
there something rather than nothing?  And who is in charge?

**Sunday, 20 March 2011**    
Jesus Is Alive - Mark 15:40-16:8    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-03-20-Mark-16-Jesus-Is-Alive.mp3)     
Mark concludes his story with an earth-shattering claim that launches
the life of the church: Jesus was really dead, but now he's alive.  He
leaves us to ask two questions.  Is it true?  And if it is true, if
Jesus really is alive, what are the implications?

**Sunday, 13 March 2011**    
Why Did Jesus Die? - Mark 14:53-65, 15:1-39    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-03-13-Mark-15-Why-Did-Jesus-Die.mp3)  
Mark's Gospel has been building to the death of Jesus all along, but
it's also raised a crucial question: *why* must Jesus die?  Mark's
telling of Jesus's trial and crucifixion removes a couple possible
explanations.  Jesus didn't die because he was guilty: the trial of
Jesus shows no one found any legitimate legal reason to kill him.  And
Jesus didn't die because he was powerless: Mark's readers know Jesus
is innocent and has power to overcome his captors, but he doesn't
defend himself.  So why then?  Jesus died to establish a kingdom you
could live in.  Mark's chief irony and his central message is that
Jesus comes to power and invites us into his kingdom through his
death.

**Sunday, 6 March 2011**    
Jesus, Our Substitute - Mark 14:1-52    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-03-06-Mark-14-Jesus-Our-Substitute.mp3)      
Describing the events leading to Jesus's arrest and crucifixion, Mark
tells us a great deal about what Jesus came here to do: He came to be
abandoned so we won't have to be.  Jesus was abandoned by
everyone--Judas, Peter, his disciples, even his Father--and,
remarkably, he chose to have it that way.  Why did he choose this path
of excruciating isolation?  Because through his death--the ultimate
abandonment--he established a covenant relationship that will never
break.

**Sunday, 27 February 2011**    
Jesus on the Future - Mark 13    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-02-27-Mark-13-The-Future.mp3)  
In the longest section of teaching recorded in Mark's Gospel, Jesus
turns to questions asked by the religious and the philosophical since
the beginning of time.  What does the future hold, and how should we
live now in light of that future?  The details of Jesus's
predictions--about the destruction of the Temple in the near future
and about his final return in power and glory--have always baffled
interpreters.  But the bottom line couldn't be more clear: because
Jesus is coming back in victory and judgment, and because we don't
know when, our responsibility is to trust Jesus and stay ready.

**Sunday, 20 February 2011**    
Religious Hypocrisy and the Love of God - Mark 11:27-12:44   
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-02-20-Mark-12-Religious-Hypocrisy.mp3)      
After a parable of judgment that sets the stage for his confrontation
with Israel's religious leaders, Jesus fields challenges from each
primary group of leaders: the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the
scribes.  In each case, Jesus's answers turn the tables on his
challengers to expose their hypocrisy.  In the end, Jesus proposes the
only solution to religious hypocrisy: a love of God for God's sake and
with everything you have.

**Sunday, 13 February 2011**   
The King Has Come - Mark 11:1-25    
*Matt McCullough*     &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-02-13-Mark-11-King-Has-Come.mp3)      
Chapter 11 marks Jesus's arrival at Jersalem, an event laced through
with prophecy fulfillment.  Here, by an "enacted parable" and by a
dramatic confrontation in the Temple, Jesus shows more of what he's
come to do.  As King, he's come to purge and to restore.

**Sunday, 6 February 2011**    
Kingdom Citizenship - Mark 10:13-52    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-02-06-Mark-10-Kingdom-Citizenship.mp3)      
To this point Mark's narrative has promised that Jesus would,
paradoxically, establish the kingdom of God through his death.  So
what does this mean for who belongs to the kingdom and how?  Mark
answers this question by contrasting stories on faith with stories on
self-reliance.  In short, the kingdom belongs to the desperate, not
the self-reliant, because it belongs to those who rest only on Jesus.

**Sunday, 30 January 2011**    
Marriage by Design, Marriage in Reality - Mark 10:1-12    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-01-30-Mark-10-Marriage-Design-Reality.mp3)     
Still on the road towards Jerusalem, Jesus shifts the focus of his
teaching on discipleship to the subject of marriage and divorce.  As
so often before, he explodes standard religious convention.  Jesus
answers a question from the Pharisees about divorce with an
explanation of God's original design for marriage.  Marriage viewed
from the perspective of creation, in the eyes of God, is an
unbreakable bond.  But how do we square Jesusâ€™s marriage ideal with
our experience in a world deeply marred by sin?

**Sunday, 23 January 2011**    
Living the Cross-Centered Life - Mark 9:30-50    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-01-23-Mark-9-Cross-Centered-Life.mp3)  
As Jesus makes his way towards Jerusalem and the death that's waiting
there for him, he narrows his focus to teaching his disciples what it
means to follow a Messiah who suffers.  The cross sets the pattern for
Christian discipleship, and this text offers concrete examples.  A
life modeled on the cross is a life that puts the interests of others
above its own, and it's a life that fights a radical battle with sin.

**Sunday, 16 January 2011**    
Belief, Unbelief, and the Saving Power of Jesus - Mark 9:14-29   
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-01-16-Mark-9-Belief-Unbelief-Power.mp3)  
In this story of demon possession and exorcism, Mark returns to one of
his favorite questions: what must we do to claim the saving power of
Jesus?  It's a story that illustrates what we know from our own
experience: unbelief comes from many sources and in many forms.  But
in the desperate plea of a helpless father Mark illustrates another,
even more powerful truth.  It's a decision to rest on Jesus--not
mathematical certainty--which constitutes the faith that leads to
deliverance.

**Sunday, 9 January 2011**   
Glory, Shame, and the Christian Paradox - Mark 9:1-13    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-01-09-Mark-9-Glory-Shame-Paradox.mp3)  
Just after Jesus has told his disciples that he must suffer and die,
and that following him means they will suffer too, Jesus reinforces
their confidence in him with a glimpse of his glory, a mysterious
event called the transfiguration.  In this story and in Jesus's
discussion with his disciples about this event, Mark helps us
understand a central Christian paradox: as Son of God Jesus is
undeniably glorious, but his glory as Messiah comes through a death of
unimaginable shame.

**Sunday, 2 January 2011**    
Jesus Is the Christ - A Review of Mark 1-8    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2011-01-02-A-Review-Of-Mark-1-8.mp3)  
The stories of Jesus's life and teaching in Mark's Gospel are designed
to answer three main questions: who is Jesus, what did Jesus come here
to do, and what does that require of us?  Already, in chapters 1-8,
we've seen the shape of Mark's answer to those crucial questions
emerge.  First, Jesus is the divine Son of God, as shown in his
unmatched words and actions of authority and power.  Second, he came
to fix what was broken, to establish the kingdom of God by his life,
death, and resurrection.  And, finally, Jesus demands absolute
submission from us: a repentance from all competing allegiances, a
rest in the sufficiency of his power and love, and a willigness to
follow him with a life of self-denial.

**Sunday, 19 December 2010**   
Christmas and the Story of Salvation - Isaiah 9:1-7   
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-12-19-Christmas-Story-of-Salvation.mp3)  
To fully appreciate why Jesus's birth matters so much, we have to
understand where it falls in the overarching story the Bible tells
about God's work of salvation.  Isaiah 9 offers one of the most
important clues, hundreds of years before Jesus was actually born.
The prophet claims that the people who walked in darkness have seen a
light because a child was born.  In other words, we've got to
understand the meaning of this darkness and we've got to understand
the meaning of this light if we're to understand the meaning of the
child.

**Sunday, 12 December 2010**   
The Christ, the Cross, and Christian Discipleship - Mark 8:31-38   
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-12-12-Mark-8-Christ-Cross-Discipleship.mp3)   
This exchange between Jesus and his disciples represents a turning
point in Mark's Gospel.  Just after Peter's climactic confession of
Jesus as the Christ, Jesus explains what kind of Christ he would be
and what that implied for all who would follow him.  Jesus explains to
his followers--and to us--that there is no Christ without the cross
and resurrection, and there is no Christian discipleship without
suffering.

**Sunday, 5 December 2010**    
Seeing and Believing - Mark 8:1-30     
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-12-05-Mark-8-Seeing-and-Believing.mp3)   
In this cluster of stories Mark helps explain why people respond to
Jesus in very different ways, some in faith and others with persistent
unbelief.  Contrasting the disciples' struggle to believe even after
all they'd seen with Peter's dramatic confession of Jesus as the
Christ, Mark shows us that spiritual sight is never the same thing as
physical sight.  Faith--seeing with new eyes--is a gift of God.

**Sunday, 28 November 2010**    
Jesus's Radical Message of Sin and Salvation - Mark 7    
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-11-28-Mark-7-Jesus-Radical-Message.mp3)   
In chapter 7, by relating Jesus's confrontation with the Pharisees
along with his ministry among the Gentiles, Mark exposes the two sides
of Jesus's radical message: the problem of sin is universal, but the
promise of salvation is universal too.

**Sunday, 21 November 2010**  
Rooted in God's Word - Psalm 119  
*John Kramp* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-11-21-Psalm-119-Rooted-In-Gods-Word.mp3)    
In this psalm, a memoir of life lived through God's word, we are
challenged to cultivate both depth and breadth in our understanding of
scripture and to apply God's Word to the raw circumstances of real
life.

**Sunday, 14 November 2010**  
Overexposure and Underappreciation - Mark 6:1-56  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-11-14-Mark-6-Overexposure-Underappreciation.mp3)  
In chapter 6 Mark illustrates how we should respond to Jesus by
contrast to two more examples of unbelief.  People in Jesus's hometown
were offended by his claims to authority because they'd been
inoculated through overexposure.  They were familiar with Jesus as
brother and son and carpenter, but he seemed too familiar for them to
accept his radical words or actions.  Jesus's disciples struggle with
another sort of unbelief, which Mark illustrates with the stories of
Jesus feeding 5000 people and Jesus walking on water.  Confronted with
vivid danger, the disciples respond in fear because, as Mark explains,
they failed to appreciate the significance of Jesus's miraculous
provision in the past.

**Sunday, 7 November 2010**  
Jesus Is More Powerful - Mark 4:35-5:43  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-11-07-Mark-4-Jesus-Is-More-Powerful.mp3)  
Mark demonstrates in these stories that Jesus is more powerful than
nature, evil, sickness, and even death.  In each case, the person or
group afflicted with their malady is paralized by fear.  Jesus's
response to them is his message to us, "Do not fear, only believe."


**Sunday, 31 October 2010**  
The Kingdom Is Like... - Mark 4:21-34  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-31-Mark-4-The-Kingdom-Is-Like.mp3)  
In this batch of parables Jesus explains what the kingdom is like by
analogy to familiar images, all of which aim to show why the kingdom
doesn't look like most expected.  The kingdom is like a lamp which,
though hidden initially, is ultimately brought in to be revealed.
It's like a seed that grows even though the farmer merely goes to
sleep and wakes up again; in other words, kingdom growth is inevitable
because God alone makes it grow.  And the kingdom is like a mustard
seed, small in its beginning but unmatched in its end.  If this is
what the kingdom is like, how do we respond?


**Sunday, 24 October 2010**  
The Gospel Divides - Mark 4:1-20  
*Matt McCullough*  
[*We regret that we are unable to provide a recording of this message.*]  
In this text Mark gives us our first extended look at Jesus's
teaching, and at his signature teaching method--the parable.  This
first parable--which involves a sower, a seed, and a variety of
soils--gives insight into the reason Jesus used parables at all, to
bring both grace and judgment.  But it's especially meant to show why
people responded in such different ways to Jesus's message.  Some
rejected him because their hearts were hardened by sin, and his word
never penetrated the surface.  Others rejected him because their
initial faith was shallow and couldn't outlive suffering.  Still
others rejected him because what Jesus called the "cares of this
world" choked out the word once planted.  These things seemed more
vivid and real than the promises of the gospel.  And then some respond
in faith from hearts of rich soil in which the gospel takes root and
grows strong.  Our Christian life, then, is about cultivating this
kind of soil, adding more and more depth to our faith and weeding out
the cares that threaten the gospel's supremacy in our hearts.


**Sunday, 17 October 2010**  
What Do We Do With Jesus? - Mark 3:7-35  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-17-Mark-3-What-Do-We-Do-With-Jesus.mp3)  
There is more than one way to respond to the claims and work of Jesus.
Mark gives us three options.  We can respond by calling him a crazy
eccentric, an evil demon, or Lord.


**Sunday, 10 October 2010**  
Jesus and Religion-as-Usual - Mark 2:18-3:6  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-10-Mark-2-3-Jesus-And-Religion.mp3)  
Mark begins to document the opposition that builds against Jesus,
ultimately leading to his execution.  Why did the religious leaders,
who were experts of the law, fail to understand the signficance of
Jesus and his kingdom?  How do we avoid similar error?  <i>(We
apologize that this recording is missing the first two
minutes. -Ed)</i>


**Sunday, 3 October 2010**  
Will You Be Forgiven? - Mark 2:1-17  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-10-03-Mark-2-Will-You-Be-Forgiven.mp3)  
At the beginning of chapter 2, Mark reveals new dimensions of Jesus's
identity and mission.  Mark's stories show that Jesus has the unique
ability to forgive sins, and that this is precisely what he came here
to do.  The only question, then, is whether you will come to Jesus for
forgiveness.


**Sunday, 26 September 2010**  
Jesus's Liberating Authority - Mark 1:16-45  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-09-26-Mark-1-Jesus-Liberating-Authority.mp3)  
In this passage Mark tells a group of stories designed to show that
Jesus came preaching the kingdom with a remarkably distinctive
authority.  But these stories also reveal a paradoxical truth:
submission to Jesus's loving authority sets you free.


**Sunday, 19 September 2010**  
Who Is Jesus? - Mark 1:1-16  
*Matt McCullough* &#8212;
[MP3](http://media.tcnash.org/2010-09-19-Mark-1-Who-Is-Jesus.mp3)  
If we are to understand why Mark labels his story about Jesus as "good
news," we must first see how he answers the three questions at the
heart of his story: Who is Jesus?  What did Jesus come here to do?
And what does that require of us?


### Sevier Park Sessions

Between February and September of 2010, a group of approximately
thirty people met weekly at a local community center to discuss why
Nashville may need another church.  Each of these sessions was
recorded and is available [here](audio/sevier.html).
