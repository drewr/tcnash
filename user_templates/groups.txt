## Covenant Groups

We believe spiritual growth happens best through mutual discipleship
as we share life together and invest in each other. Beginning with our
public launch this September, we encourage you to participate in one
of our small groups that focus on deepening relationships through
discussion, prayer, and accountability. These groups, capped at around
15 adults, will meet in homes during the week to share a meal, discuss
the weekly sermon or a particular book, and pray for each other.

Check back here for more info on these groups and how you can get involved.
