## Discipleship

Learning to be a follower of Jesus is about working the implications
of the gospel into the details of our daily lives. That’s
discipleship. In addition to our Covenant Groups, we plan to help you
grow in Christ through a weekly time of teaching we’ll call Sunday
School, unless we can come up with something more creative.

And if you’re interested in learning more about Christianity or what
it means to live a gospel-centered life, we have people standing by
who would love to walk with you through a simple 9-week study that
should help answer some of your questions.
