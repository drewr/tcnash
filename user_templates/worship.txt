## Worship

The Bible describes God as a God of light, revealing truth that
illuminates our hearts and minds. The foundation of our worship is the
fact that God has spoken to us. In the Bible, he has told us what he
is like and, just as important, what he has done for us. When we
gather for worship, we reflect the light shone on us in his Word, back
to God in praise and thanksgiving and towards each other for mutual
encouragement. In our weekly services we will read God’s Word, pray
God’s Word, sing God’s Word, and hear God’s Word preached to us.

* We will read together and pray over passages that speak of the
  glorious being and nature of God, the terrible reality of our sin,
  and the message of hope and redemption in Christ.

* We will sing, to God and each other, songs that celebrate the
  wonderful character of God, songs that confess our sinfulness, and
  songs that thank God for the beautiful promise that he has made a
  solution for problems too big for us.

* And we will hear sermons that explain the meaning of the Bible and
  its individual books, their meaning as written in their original
  contexts and as applied to our lives in this time and place.
