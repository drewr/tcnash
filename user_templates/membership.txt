## Membership

This September Trinity Church will accept its first batch of church
members. If you’re interested in learning more about church
membership, what it means and why it matters, we’ll be spending most
of our August meetings talking about it. In the meantime, take a look
at our [church covenant](covenant.html), which defines the
responsibilities of members to each other, and check out some great
material on the subject at <http://9marks.org>.
