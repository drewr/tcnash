## Our Leadership

Trinity Church exists as an autonomous congregation, which means that
no institution outside the church has authority over its
affairs. Instead, the congregation governs itself under the leadership
of a group of men called elders.

The elders share the primary responsibility for teaching, pastoral
care, and decisions related to healthy church operation. Elders of the
church should meet the personal qualifications described by Paul in 1
Timothy 3 and Titus 1, and they must be set apart by the congregation
to serve in this shepherding role.

Until Trinity Church has members to officially affirm its first set of
elders, the elders of [Grace Community Church](http://gccnashville.org
"GCC Nashville"), our sending and partnering congregation, have
affirmed a group of four men to serve in that capacity as a
provisional leadership team. To learn more about Bill Heerman, Dave
Hunt, Matt McCullough, and Drew Raines, click here (TODO: link to
bios).

Though Trinity is an autonomous Baptist congregation, we do enjoy a
friendly partnership with the churches of the Southern Baptist
Convention for international missions, church planting, education,
disaster relief efforts, and care for the poor and orphans.
