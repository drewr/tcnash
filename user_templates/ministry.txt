## Ministry

As a church affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, we
participate in international missions primarily through the
[International Mission Board](http://imb.org "IMB").

And as we prepare to launch this fall we are also actively working to
form partnerships with like-minded local organizations for mercy
ministry here in Nashville. Check back here for updates on these
partnerships and how you can get involved.
