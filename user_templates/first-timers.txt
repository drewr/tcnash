## First-Timers

Until the public launch in mid-September 2010, Trinity Church meets
for Bible study and prayer on Sunday evenings at the Sevier Park
Community Center in the 12th South neighborhood of Nashville. The
meetings begin at 5:30PM and last until approximately 7:00PM. Everyone
is welcome, and childcare is provided.

What can you expect? Our meetings are very informal. We spend some
time chatting over coffee and snacks. We spend some time singing and
praying over the specific needs of the church as we prepare for the
Fall. And we spend some time discussing the Bible and how it informs
what our church will look like.

If youâ€™re interested, our pastor would love to take you out for
coffee. Just call Matt at 615-307-0722 or email <matt@tcnash.org>.
